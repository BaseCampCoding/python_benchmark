# PYTHON BENCHMARK
## FRIDAY 04 OCTOBER 2019
-------------------------

#### Goal
To create a library based application that allows the user to check out and return books. For this application, it is assumed that the user is a librarian; therefore, the text interface does not need to be as rich.

#### App Requirements
* The user should only be able to check out or return valid books (i.e. the book should be in stock in order to be checked-in)
* Each check-in is logged in the log.txt file following the same format as the existing logs
* No modifications to the data files (can only edit the data files to return them to their default state)
* All inputs should have _reasonable_ validation
* The json file should be saved to update the status of the book.

#### Passing & Completion Notes
A student passes the benchmark if.... 
* a user is able to check out a book, log the transaction, and save the inventory
* the application is all dynamically loaded (i.e. no hard coding), has basic input validation, and the code is well organized
A student completes this benchmark if...
* all the conditions above are met
* the user is able to check a book back in, log the transaction and update the inventory
* the code is very well organized and extracted in the purposeful functions
* implements some UX features to improve the design and make the information easier to understand
